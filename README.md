# got
A clone of the git vcs written in Go. 

This work is based on the book [_Building Git_](https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/) by James Coglan.

I will try to tag the repository state according to the chapter titles.

## Install
`go get -u github.com/neocortical/got`

## Use
Just like using `git`, except it's buggy and most of the features aren't implemented!
